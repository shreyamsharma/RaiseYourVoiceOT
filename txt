              <h3> <strong>What is Raise Your Voice?</strong></h3>
              <p>
                Raise Your Voice is a nonpartisan project aimed at connecting young
                 Canadians to the countryâ€™s current politics and politicians. Our 
                 goal is to unite the voice of youth across Canada and to empower
                  the next generation of activists to disrupt the status quo on 
                  parliament hill. Over the course of our first year (2020-2021),
                   we launched a three part workshop called creating your political
                    handbook to teach youth the basics of political literacy and how 
                    to start their own personal activism.

                      We aim to continue our goal by launching an e-book in order to teach more youth the power and impact of raising your voice. Our current initiatives include partnering with local community members in order to host more workshops and future campaigns aimed at empowering local youth. We plan to expand our operations from Ontario Tech University into the surrounding Durham Region areas.
