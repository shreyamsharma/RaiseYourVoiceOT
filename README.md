# RaiseYourVoiceOT
<br>
Raise Your Voice is a nonpartisan project aimed at connecting young Canadians to the countryâ€™s current politics and politicians.

Being a Tech Lead at Enactus, I designed and implemented innovative ideas to create a new website, and have used a range of technologies such as
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and PHP to integrate website functionalities and features. 

Here is a link to the website - https://www.raiseyourvoiceot.ca/
